This is my portfolio website, where I showcase my most important projects.

## Table of Contents
- Split into three sections: about me, projects view, and contact me area.
- Navigation buttons to scroll to other sections.
- Resume button to visualize and download my resume.
- A collection of projects presented as cards. Click each to view more details in the back.
- Contact form built with FormSubmit.co to reach out to me via email.
- Lots of nice animations.
